# Arrays & Objects

### Getting Started

1. Create two files `index.html` and `script.js`
1. Include `script.js` in `index.html` using a `<script>` tag
1. Open `index.html` in your web browser and open the console
1. After answering each section below, `git commit` your work
1. When you're finished push to your fork and file a Pull Request to the main homework repo

### Research Array Methods on MDN

Read up on JavaScript Array methods. You'll need a few to solve the sections below.

- https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp
- https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array

As a developer, you'll be reading documentation a lot so it's good to get used to the way documentation is written (unfortunately, while technically correct, they're not always written well).

### Where's Waldo

Copy and paste this array into `script.js`:

``` js
const whereIsWaldo = [["Timmy", "Frank"], "Eggbert",
                      ["Lucinda", "Jacc", "Neff", "Snoop"],
                      ["Petunia", ["Baked Goods", "Waldo"]]]
```

1. Remove Eggbert (hint look at the slice/splice method(s))
1. Change "Neff" to "No One"
1. Access and console.log "Waldo"

### Array Restaurant

A restaurant serves the following items in their menu (place these in an array):
- chicken
- apple pie
- soup
- steak
- salad
- turkey sandwich
- potato bake

1. Use the array method `.sort` to alphabetize the menu items
1. Use an array method to remove the 1st item from the array.
1. Use an array method to remove the 3rd item from the array.
1. Prompt a user for what they would like to eat from the menu.
    For example, if the user answers "chicken", check if the item exists in the array using an array method, and either console.log:
    - "Sure, the chicken will be served in 15 minutes" OR
    - "Sorry, we don't have that".

### The Solar System, Part 1

The following object, `solarSystem`, is a common data structure: an **array** of **objects**. You will see this particular data structure more and more as you venture into JSON and servers. This one is an **array** of **objects** which also contains **arrays**.

Note that the objects do not have names. They are just anynmous objects listed in an array. 

Copy and paste this object into `objects.js`:

``` js
const solarSystem = [
  { name: 'Mercury', ringSystem: false, moons: [] },
  { name: 'Venus', ringSystem: false, moons: [] },
  { name: 'Earth', ringSystem: false, moons: ['The Moon'] },
  { name: 'Mars', ringSystem: false, moons: ['Phobos', 'Deimos'] },
  { name: 'Jupiter', ringSystem: true, moons: ['Europa', 'Ganymede', 'Io', 'Callisto'] },
  { name: 'Saturn', ringSystem: true, moons: ['Titan', 'Enceladus', 'Rhea', 'Mimas'] },
  { name: 'Uranus', ringSystem: true, moons: ['Miranda', 'Titania', 'Ariel', 'Umbriel'] },
  { name: 'Neptune', ringSystem: true, moons: ['Triton', 'Nereid'] }
]
```

Write Javascript that does the following:

1. Print the array of Jupiter's moons to the console (no _for loop_, just print the entire array).
1. Print the name of Neptune's moon "Nereid" to the console.
1. Add a new moon called "Endor" to Venus' moons array.
1. Add a Pluto object to the solarSystem array using .push. The object should contain Pluto's name, ringSystem boolean, and moons array (which includes "Charon").
1. Add a new key value pair to the the Earth object: the key should be 'diameter', and the value should be Earth's diameter in miles represented as a string.
1. Change Mercury's ringSystem boolean to true.
1. Change Uranus' moon "Umbriel" to "Oberon"
1. Iterate through the solarSystem array and print only the objects that have a ringSystem (where ringSystem: true), and ignore the others. You want to make a loop that goes over each item in the array, and include an if statement.

    Example output:
    ``` text
    { name: 'Mercury', ringSystem: true, moons: [] }
    { name: 'Jupiter', ringSystem: true, moons: [ 'Europa', 'Ganymede', 'Io', 'Callisto' ] }
    { name: 'Saturn', ringSystem: true, moons: [ 'Titan', 'Enceladus', 'Rhea', 'Mimas' ] }
    { name: 'Uranus', ringSystem: true, moons: [ 'Miranda', 'Titania', 'Ariel', 'Oberon' ] }
    { name: 'Neptune', ringSystem: true, moons: [ 'Triton', 'Nereid' ] }
    ```

### The Solar System, Part 2

Copy and paste this **object** into `objects.js` (Click on the "Copy to clipboard" button on the upper right of the code block).

Take a closer look at the structure as this is an **object of objects** not an array of objects.

}
```

Write code that does the following:

1. Print the mass of Mercury
1. Print the eccentricity of Venus
1. Print the sum of the number of satellites of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (131)
1. Write a conditional that checks if Mercury's `radiusp` is a string (remember the `typeof` command). If Mercury's `radiusp` is a string, change the value to be the same as its `radiuse` value. (`radiusp` is radius at the poles, `radiuse` is radius at the equator).
1. Print Mercury's `radiusp` (should be 2439, not 'same').
1. Find the difference between Jupiter's **momentum** and Pluto's **momentum**. (To get momentum, you'll want the product of **velocity** and **mass**). 

#### Planet X

Outside of any of these predefined solar system objects, make your own object called `PlanetX`. Give `PlanetX` the same properties as a planet within `system` (eg. density, tilt, mass) and give it made-up values.

Without directly altering either the `system` object or the `PlanetX` object, include `PlanetX` as a property of system. (Your `PlanetX` object is a planet within the system).

When you console.log(`system`), `PlanetX` should be appear as a planet in the system.

### The Reading List

Keep track of which books you read and which books you want to read!

1a. Create an array of 5 objects, where each object is a book containing a title (a string), author (a string), and alreadyRead (a boolean indicating if you read it yet).

1b. Iterate through the array of books. For each book, log the book title and book author like so: "The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien".

1c. Now update the code from 1b to use an if/else statement to output one of the two following strings, depending on whether you've read it yet:

    "You already read The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien"
    "You still need to read The Hobbit by J.R.R. Tolkien."
