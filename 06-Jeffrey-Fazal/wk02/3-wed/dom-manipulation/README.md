# DOM Manipulation

Can you really _manipulate_ The DOM though?

Yea I didn't think so... Thankfully we're not talking about _that_ Dom.

### Getting Started

1. Write your answers inside the `script.js`.
1. While you're working, make sure to open the `index.html` file in your browser to test your work.
1. There are empty functions for each part. Don't forget to **call** the function.
1. Commit after completing each part below.

#### Part 1

DOM's personal website title is a bit wordy. Write a JavaScript statement that selects the `#main-title` ID element. Change the **text** of the title to something shorter.

#### Part 2

Select the `body` and change the background-color to a new color of your choice.

#### Part 3

Select **DOM's Favorite Things** list and remove the last list item.

#### Part 4

Select all `.special-title` class elements and change their `font-size` to `2rem`. Remember you might have to iterate through the list of elements

#### Part 5

Turns out DOM never raced in **Chicago**. Access the **Past Races** list and remove **Chicago**.

#### Part 6 x

Let's add to DOM's **Past Races** list. Create a new `<li>` element, change the new `<li>` text to the name of a city, and append it to the **Past Races** list.

#### Part 7

Create a new `.blog-post` corresponding to the new city added in **Part 6**. You will have to create a new `<div>` with class of `.blog-post`, a new `<h2>` with text, and a new `<p>` with some text. Think about what order you want to create the elements, and what order you want to append them in.
